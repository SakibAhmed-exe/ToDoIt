# ToDoIt
This is my take on the classic ToDo App. This application was bootstrapped with react-create-app. I've included some pictures below to give you an idea of how it works.

## How to Run

In terminal, just type `npm run start` in the same directory as the project! Then, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application in 
your browser of choice. Edits made to the code will be rendered in real-time. 

## `Features`

I've implemented a handful of frameworks/libraries for this project: React.js, Material UI, and and Redux, tsparticles. 

Material UI was used to create a responsive layout that can adapt to any screen size. Use of the Grid component helps make this project look great on any screen! I added tsparticles to create some background animations and make the application look more interesting, i.e. adding emojis that fly across the page. I used CSS3 to style my components, such as adding hover effects for Grid items. Redux is used for state management and dispatching actions, i.e. editing an item, deleting an item.
